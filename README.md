# Maxooz's minesweeper

## How it works

To start, you can just select your game mode and press "Play". Then you just have to longpress to flag a tile (if you think there is a bomb), or shortpress if you want to reveal the tile (if that is a bomb, you lose).
If you want to restart, you can just refresh the page.

## How it was made

I made it using vanillaJS. I used JS as a proto-framework, to change DOM's element. Using HTML element allows me to use HTML events, which makes the whole implementation way easier.

## Why it was made

I just wanted to test if I could build it in a few hours. I wanted to do it in 2 hours at the beginning, and I then spent 3 - 4 hours making it a bit better, and playable.
